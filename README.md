## What does it contain?
> For now, only:
- Music playback
- Pause and resume system
- Skip and back system
- Jump system to skip to any music in the queue (maximum 25)
- Stop function to stop the music and disconnect the bot

## Possible bugs
The system is fully functional, although it has some bugs that will be fixed later.
Some bugs may include:
- It may take some time to process the music, mainly due to the size and duration of the video/music being searched for.
- When the music queue ends, it may not repeat in a loop. This will be fixed with future updates.
